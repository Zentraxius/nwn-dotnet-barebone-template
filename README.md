# NWN Dotnet Barebone Template #
By [Wytchwood](https://github.com/Wytchwood "Wytchwood")

This is a minimal (one file) implementation of NWNXEE DotNet using the [NWN.Core](https://github.com/nwn-dotnet/NWN.Core) library. It is intended for those who would like to build their own implementations from the ground up. See documentation in comments.
